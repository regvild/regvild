Data analyst
------------
* üåç  I'm based in Ufa, Russia

At the last place of work, I noticed how interesting it is for me to work in Excel in terms of analysis, automation, design. Due to personal circumstances, I decided to take a break from work in 2022 and during this period I took a Data Analyst course to understand and evaluate my interest in analysis, to gain skills to optimize my work. During my studies, I was inspired by innovation and how data analysis helps businesses earn money, and realized that I wanted to join this system. I am impressed by the idea in the analyst profession that, as well as working as a customer service manager, I can bring direct profit to the business, which is transparently expressed in measurable quantities. This profession gives you the opportunity to participate in important business projects. I like to observe, study, look for patterns and draw conclusions that change the object for the better, present the results. One of my key goals is self-development, improvement of professional skills and competence. I am glad to have any communication on the subject of my profile.
